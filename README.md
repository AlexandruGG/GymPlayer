# GymPlayer
**Use**: A music playing app for the gym with songs curated based on the type of workout performed.<br/>
**Developing Purpose**: Learning to build a multi-screen app with more than one activity. The app uses explicit intents to open new activities, and features music playing capabilities like play, pause, stop, seek through song (via SeekBar). *Points of improvement*: implementing skip to next/previous track and persisting music playing when the user exits the app or powers off the screen. <br/>
**Context**: Project created as part of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree (https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)
